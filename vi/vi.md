## **`vi` Editor Commands for Beginners!**

While there are a number of `vi` commands, just a handful of these is usually sufficient for beginning `vi` users. 

To assist such users, like learning peers from the ALX Software Engineering Program, this repo contains a sampling of basic `vi` commands.

## Modes of Operation 

Here are the two most common _modes of operation_

1. **:keyboard: [Command Mode](command-mode/README.md)**
    - Commands which cause an action to be taken on a file 
    
1. **:writing_hand: [Insert Mode](insert-mode/README.md)**
    - Entered text is inserted into a file or overwrites existing content.

> Every character typed in command mode acts as a command to the file being edited. In insert mode, every character typed is addedd to the text in the file.
 - Pressing `esc` (Escape) key turns off insert mode.

## To exit `vi`

Usually you can easily leave vi by saving or quiting on the currently modified file.. 
> But however, it is also possible to quit vi without saving the file

- **:floppy_disk: [Saving/Reading Files](/vi/saving/README.md)**

    - **NOTE:** _Both UNIX and vi are case-sensitive. Be sure not to use a capital letter in place of a lowercase letter; the results will not be what you expect._
